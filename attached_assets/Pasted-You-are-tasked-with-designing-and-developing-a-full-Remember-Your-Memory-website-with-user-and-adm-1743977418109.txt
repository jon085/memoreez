You are tasked with designing and developing a full "Remember Your Memory" website with user and admin functionalities. The project requirements will be provided to you. Your goal is to create a comprehensive project outline that covers database design, backend development, frontend development, and security measures.

Here are the project requirements:

Please follow these instructions to create your project outline:

1. Database Design:
   - Design a relational database schema that accommodates all the required features.
   - Include tables for users, memories, categories, and any other necessary entities.
   - Define relationships between tables, including foreign key constraints.
   - Ensure the schema supports both public and private memories.
   - Design tables to support admin functionalities like user management and content moderation.

2. Backend Development:
   - Choose an appropriate server-side language and framework - Node.js with Express or better
   - Implement RESTful API endpoints for all required functionalities.
   - Create controllers and models to handle data operations.
   - Implement user authentication and authorization systems.
   - Develop admin dashboard functionalities.
   - Implement email verification for user registration.

3. Frontend Development:
   - Choose a frontend framework - React
   - Design and implement the following pages:
     a. Homepage
     b. User registration and login
     c. Profile edit and creation
     d. Add memory page
     e. View memories page (personal and public)
     f. Category management page
     g. Admin dashboard
   - Ensure responsive design for various device sizes.
   - Implement client-side form validation.

4. Security Measures:
   - Implement input validation and sanitization on both client and server sides.
   - Use prepared statements or ORM to prevent SQL injection.
   - Implement CSRF protection.
   - Use secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
   - Use HTTPS for all communications.
   - Implement proper session management.
   - Apply Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
   - Regularly update and patch all dependencies.

5. Additional Considerations:
   - Implement proper error handling and logging.
   - Design a scalable architecture to handle potential growth.
   - Consider implementing caching mechanisms for improved performance.
   - Plan for data backup and recovery procedures.

Please provide a comprehensive project outline based on these instructions. Your outline should include specific technologies, frameworks, and libraries you recommend for each component of the project. Also, provide a high-level overview of the database schema and API endpoints.

Present your project outline in the following format:

<project_outline>
1. Technology Stack
2. Database Schema
3. API Endpoints
4. Frontend Components
5. Security Measures
6. Additional Considerations
</project_outline>

Ensure that your outline is detailed, well-structured, and addresses all the requirements and security concerns mentioned in the project requirements.
